# Dependency Policy

## Status
Implemented

Bashkit is embedded by other people's programs, so every crate in the tree is a
crate a downstream consumer inherits, audits, and receives advisories for. The
default posture is therefore to keep the graph small — but "small" means *audit
surface*, not binary size, and the two are measured separately because they do
not move together.

## What the graph actually costs

Measured on `bashkit` at the browser feature set
(`--no-default-features --features scripted_tool,jq`):

| Configuration | Crates |
|---|---|
| `--no-default-features` | 112 → 91 after the trims below |
| `+ jq` | +21 |
| `+ http_client` | +36 |
| `+ typescript` | +47 |
| `+ python` | +67 |
| `+ ssh` | +89 |
| `+ sqlite` | +89 |

The embedded-runtime features dominate, and each is already off by default and
gated. The always-on core is where trimming is worth the effort.

## Trims in effect

Each is documented at its definition in the root `Cargo.toml`; the rationale
lives there, next to the pin, so it cannot drift away from what it explains.

- **`idna_adapter` pinned to 1.0.0** (lockfile-only). Removes the 21-crate
  ICU4X stack that `url` pulls in via `idna`. Consequence: non-ASCII domain
  names are rejected rather than normalised per UTS 46 — hardening for a
  sandbox allowlist, since it removes the homograph and punycode-confusion
  class from host matching.
- **`clap` with `default-features = false`.** Drops `color` and `suggestions`:
  7 crates whose job is to detect and paint a host TTY. Builtins write to the
  sandbox's virtual stdout, which is never a terminal.
- **`futures-util` with `default-features = false`.** Bashkit uses `StreamExt`,
  `FutureExt`, and `select`/`pin_mut!` only.
- **`chrono-tz` behind the `tzdata` feature** (on by default). Worth 911 KB of
  the browser wasm binary. See
  [Gate rather than reimplement](#gate-rather-than-reimplement).

## Measure size and audit surface separately

The `idna_adapter` pin removes 21 crates but only **15 KB (0.16%)** from the
release `wasm32-unknown-unknown` browser build, because LTO already dead-strips
the ICU tables — they sit behind lazy statics the linker proves unreachable.
Source-tree size is not a proxy for shipped bytes: `icu_properties_data` is
1.9 MB of source and near-zero shipped weight.

So: justify a dependency trim by audit surface, cold build time, and build
output size — and measure the binary before claiming anything about it. The
same pin is worth ~10% off a cold `cargo check` and ~70 MB of build output.

A trim also may not apply to every configuration. `turso_core` pulls
`icu_collator`, so any build with the `sqlite` feature keeps the ICU stack
regardless of the `idna_adapter` pin.

## Deliberately not reimplemented

Re-implementing a dependency in-house is occasionally right — the vendored
uucore argument surfaces in [Coreutils Args Port](../runtimes/coreutils-args-port.md)
are the precedent — but for the current tree it is not, and the reasons are
worth keeping so the question does not get re-litigated from scratch.

- **`url`** — the strongest-looking candidate and the wrong one. `reqwest`
  depends on `url` regardless, so under `http_client` a hand-rolled parser
  does not leave the tree; it only introduces a **parser differential between
  the URL Bashkit validates against the allowlist and the URL that actually
  gets fetched**, which is an SSRF allowlist bypass. `network/allowlist.rs`
  carries no `cfg(http_client)` gate — it is always compiled and always public
  API. After the `idna_adapter` pin `url` costs 6 crates. Keep it.
- **`flate2`, `bzip2`** — already pure Rust (`miniz_oxide`, `libbz2-rs-sys`),
  4 and 1 unique crates. Reimplementing DEFLATE or bzip2 is weeks of work
  against a compatibility surface with no margin for error.
- **`clap`** — used across ~25 files and emitted against by the coreutils port
  codegen. Trim its features; do not replace it.
- **`bigdecimal` / `num-bigint`** — back `printf`'s arbitrary precision. Three
  unique crates is a poor trade against bignum decimal correctness.
- **`md-5`, `sha1`, `sha2`, `hmac`** — zero unique crates each; they share the
  RustCrypto `digest` core. Reimplementing saves nothing and it is crypto.
- **`os_display`, `unit-prefix`** — genuinely trivial (3 crates, and
  `shell_quote` in `builtins/generated/format_support.rs` already covers most
  of `Quotable`), but they are imported by *generated* coreutils-port files, so
  removal means carrying rewrite rules in the porter. Low return.

## Gate rather than reimplement

Where a dependency is large but its domain is not something to reimplement, the
lever is a feature gate rather than an in-house rewrite.

`chrono-tz` is the worked example. It backs three lines of `builtins/date.rs`
(`TZ=` parsing) and is the largest single artifact in the tree — an 18.6 MB
rlib of compiled IANA tables that costs **911 KB (9.7%)** of the release
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` browser binary, 9,361,014 → 8,450,035 bytes.

That number is the contrast with the `idna_adapter` pin above, and the reason
the two are justified differently: ICU's tables are reachable only through code
paths LTO can prove dead, so they cost 15 KB; chrono-tz's are reached from a
`FromStr` over the whole zone table, so the linker must keep them. Whether a
large data dependency actually ships depends on how it is reached, which is why
the rule is to measure rather than reason from source size. Timezone rules are emphatically not a
reimplementation target, so it sits behind the **`tzdata`** feature, on by
default and listed explicitly by `bashkit-cli` and `bashkit-capi`, and
deliberately absent from `bashkit-wasm`.

Turning it off narrows the closed timezone set of `TM-INF-018` to UTC alone.
`date` then **reports that it cannot honour a named zone and exits 1**, rather
than formatting in UTC and returning a timestamp that looks right. Degrading
silently is the tempting choice and the wrong one: the caller cannot tell a
correct answer from a wrong one, and the failure surfaces later as bad data.
Unset, empty, `TZ=UTC`, and path-style values are unaffected — path-style forms
are a rejected request for a host zoneinfo file, not a request for a named
zone, so they resolve to UTC in every build and must not diverge with the
feature.

The diagnostic never echoes the `TZ` value. A `TZ` can be path-shaped, and
reflecting it back is exactly how host state leaks into output; the existing
`invalid_timezone_fails_closed_without_echoing_host_state` guards the same
property on the other side of the gate.

`tests/integration/date_timezone_no_tzdata_tests.rs` pins the off side; the
`tzdata`-on modules beside it pin the other, and `main.rs` selects between them
so both configurations have coverage rather than one silently losing it.

The generalisable rule: when a dependency is large, narrow in use, and wraps a
domain with real correctness stakes (timezones, compression, crypto, Unicode),
gate it and give both sides of the gate tests. Do not reimplement it, and do not
leave the gated-off configuration untested.

## Gyde fork

The `gyde/shell-fixes` branch starts at upstream
`88caad974ed9ed72814b0e9185cbf283c55890ff` (Bashkit 0.17.1). It carries the
interpreter, retry, command-discovery, and stat fixes previously embedded in
agent-machine 0.3.1. Keeping this base preserves the released runtime behavior;
moving to a newer upstream revision is a separate dependency upgrade.

The fork keeps the upstream workspace and license intact. Consumers select an
exact Git commit through Cargo rather than copying the crate into their source
tree. No Bashkit registry publication is needed for this distribution path.

`retry` executes in the existing interpreter with exact arguments and stdin,
shared shell state and resource limits, bounded output and delays, and the last
attempt's status. `command -v`/`-V` inspect every operand and honor redirections;
`stat -c '%Y'` and `'%y'` format the filesystem's modification timestamp.
These behaviors are covered by
`crates/bashkit/tests/integration/shell_patch_tests.rs`, with native runtime and
workspace-recovery coverage retained in agent-machine. See
[Builtin Commands](../foundations/builtins.md) for dispatch ownership.
